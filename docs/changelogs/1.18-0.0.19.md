# 1.18 (API v0.0.19)

## Additions

### Commands

- Added `/blueberry version`
- Added `/cblueberry` (client only)

## Changes

### Core

- Removed packet rewriter
    - Use [MultiVersion](https://github.com/acrylic-style/MultiVersion) for equivalent feature
- Don't load mod resources by default
    - Mod resources caused resource manager to completely mess up (like not loading textures correctly);
        mod resources will be loaded by default again after this has been resolved

### API

- Removed `net.blueberrymc.network.FriendlyByteBuf`
- Throw exception when duplicate mod id is detected

## Fixes
- Stacktrace of event exception is not shown
- Client commands suggestions are not shown
