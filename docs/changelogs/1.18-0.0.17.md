# 1.18 (API v0.0.17)

Blueberry is now based on 1.18.

## Additions

### API

- Add `YamlArray#mapToString()` which returns `List<String>` as a result
- Add `Event#getEventTypeName()` which returns full type name of the event (equivalent to `event.getClass().getTypeName()`)

### Multiplayer

- Add ability to ignore server render distance
- Add Packet Rewriter
    - Allows you to join the server with different versions.

## Changes

### Core

- No longer supports Java 16 (which is already EOL)
    - because Minecraft is now Java 17
- Installer will now patch the jar automatically when installing
- Don't wait on resource manager reload when disabling mod
- Debug packets now can be toggled to on/off

### API

- Overhauled VisualConfig
- Rework BlueberryNetworkManager, BlueberryPacket
- `BlueberryServer#getResourceManager()` returns non-null value now
    - `BlueberryUtil#getResourceManager()` is now `@NotNull` too.
- Improve annotation test output when test fails (hopefully)
- EventException prints stacktrace on logger (with error level) instead of stderr

### General
- Some `Class#getCanonicalName()` are now replaced with `Class#getTypeName()`
