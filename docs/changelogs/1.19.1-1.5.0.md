# (Unreleased) 1.19.1 (API v1.5.0)

## Changes

### API

- Deprecate Listener (`net.blueberrymc.common.bml.event.Listener`) for removal in 2.0.0.
    - Remove `implements Listener` for quick migration
    - Method parameter of Listener type is now replaced with `java.lang.Object` (old methods are now deprecated for removal)
    - Most methods have the same name as old one, except for `HandlerList#remove(Listener)`. This method is now called `removeListener(Object)`.

### Core

- Update bundled kotlin version to 1.7.0 (previous version was 1.6.10 and 1.6.20, they were really mixed, and this version finally fixes that.)
